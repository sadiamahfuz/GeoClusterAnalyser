GeoCluster Analyser
Author: Syeda Sadia Mahfuz

Problem Description:

Introduction:
A rectangular grid is overlaid on a piece of a map such that the map is divided up into squares of land. 
These squares are called Geos and the encompassing rectangle is called a GeoBlock. 
Users can purchase these Geos. When they are purchased, they become “occupied”.
Each Geo has an ID within the GeoBlock, starting from 0 in the bottom-left corner, moving left to right along the bottom row,
then up to the next row, left to right along that and so on until the top right Geo is reached.

A Geo Cluster is defined as being a set of occupied Geos where each one is adjacent to one or more other occupied Geos.
(i.e. directly above, below, or to the left or right of)

Occupied Geos are specified using an ASCII CSV file format. 
Each line contains the following fields: 
	Geo ID, Occupier’s username, Date the Geo was occupied from in YYYY-MM-DD format

Task Description:
Write a command-line program in Java that takes three parameters:
􏰀	Width of GeoBlock (in number of Geos)
􏰀	Height of GeoBlock (in number of Geos)
􏰀	Name of the CSV file that defines the occupied Geos for that GeoBlock
It should output the details of the Geos in the cluster with the largest number of Geos in it. 
The details should include all the information about the Geos that was available in the CSV.

Example:
java GeoClusterAnalyser 4 7 Files/example.csv
	The Geos in the largest cluster of occupied Geos for this GeoBlock are:
		13, Matt, 2010-10-14
		17, Patrick, 2011-03-10
		21, Catherine, 2011-02-25
		22, Michael, 2011-02-25
where example.csv looks like:
4, Tom, 2010-10-10
5, Katie, 2010-08-24
6, Nicole, 2011-01-09
11, Mel, 2011-01-01
13, Matt, 2010-10-14
15, Mel, 2011-01-01
17, Patrick, 2011-03-10
21, Catherine, 2011-02-25
22, Michael, 2011-02-25

Example2 with same example.csv:
java GeoClusterAnalyser 7 4 Files/example.csv
	The Geos in the largest cluster of occupied Geos for this GeoBlock are:
		4, Tom, 2010-10-10
		5, Katie, 2010-08-24
		6, Nicole, 2011-01-09
		11, Mel, 2011-01-01
		13, Matt, 2010-10-14
	
Notes:
1) If the CSV file contains invalid data or incomplete information, then the faulty entry is ignored,
   and the next line is read.
